Here, you will get an overview of all the functions within the Autodarts Desktop Client.


## Menu Bar
On the top right, you'll find the menu bar with the following menus:

![Menu Bar](/Autodarts-Desktop/images/14_menue_bar.png) </br>
- Home (The "House" Icon) </br>
    will open the Home screen </br>

- Vision (The "Eye" Icon) </br>
    will open the vision overview (helpful for debugging) </br>

- Configuration (The "Gear" Icon) </br>
    will open the camera configuration menu </br>

- User menu (Click on your name) </br>
    will open a sub menu </br>

## Home

On the right hand side the Home screen will show you the different board states (Throw, Takeout, Takeout detection) and the recognized darts.

On the left-hand side, you will find controls (Restart, Stop, Reset), information about the software version, and the ability to check for updates. There's an option for Automatic Detection Updates and some external links that will direct you to play.autodarts.io, the documentation, and the official Discord server.

## Vision
{{<hint type=info icon=gdoc_info_outline >}}
The Vision screen is for debugging purposes and will replace the previous Board Manager.

You can choose between the "Motion Detection" or the "Dart Detection" tab. The motion tab will display the motion within your board, and the dart tab will show you the detected darts from all camera angles for each camera.

## Configuration
In the Configuration, you will find all necessary options for your cameras and calibration settings known from the setup process. Here you can choose your cameras, change the resolution, frames per second, and the camera standby time.

Please note that starting from version 0.24.0, the algorithm takes care of possible distortion in your camera lens. That means, with software versions above 0.24.0, you do **not** have to manually adjust distortion if needed.
{{< /hint >}}
Below each camera you will find four buttons with the following abilities:

- The double arrow icon will flip your camera by 180 degrees.

- The magic wand icon will calibrate the camera.

- The left arrow icon will move the red "20" mark one field to the left.

- The right arrow icon will move the red "20" mark one field to the right.

At the bottom, you have the ability to enable "automatic calibration" and calibrate all cameras at once with the "Calibrate" button.

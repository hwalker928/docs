## Mounting Options

{{<hint type=important icon=gdoc_error_outline >}}
Always check the design specifications for correct **distance and angle** before printing or purchasing designs in case of 3D printed solutions. Some designs, like most click-on mounts for Target Corona Vision rings, may not meet the necessary requirements.

You have the freedom to build your own camera arms using any materials of your choice. Here are some common approaches:

*   **Wooden cases**: Some users build enclosures around their dartboard, ensuring cameras are correctly placed while keeping them hidden.
*   **3D-printed mounts**: Ready-to-use designs are available on platforms like:
    *   [Cults3D](https://cults3d.com)
    *   [Printables](https://printables.com)
    *   [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com)

## Mounting Options

You have the freedom to build your own camera arms using any materials of your choice. Here are some common approaches:

*   **Wooden cases**: Some users build enclosures around their dartboard, ensuring cameras are correctly placed while keeping them hidden.
*   **3D-printed mounts**: Ready-to-use designs are available on platforms like:
    *   [Cults3D](https://cults3d.com)
    *   [Printables](https://printables.com)
    *   [Thingiverse](https://thingiverse.com)

{{<hint type=important icon=gdoc_error_outline >}}Always check the design specifications for correct **distance and angle** before printing or purchasing. Some designs, like **click-on mounts for Target Corona Vision rings**, may not meet the necessary requirements.{{< /hint >}}

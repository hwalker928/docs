# Basic Game Rules

Bermuda is a dart game variant that combines elements of both cricket and X01. In this variant you have to hit the given fields 3 times each in the following order:

Round 1:    12 </br>
Round 2:    13 </br>
Round 3:    14 </br>
Round 4:    a double field or the bullseye </br>
Round 5:    15 </br>
Round 6:    16 </br>
Round 7:    17 </br>
Round 8:    a triple field </br>
Round 9:    18 </br>
Round 10:   19 </br>
Round 11:   20 </br>
Round 12:   Bull or Bullseye </br>
Round 13:   Bullseye </br>

The points depend on the hit fields; a hit single field gives single points, a hit double field gives double points, and a triple field gives triple points.

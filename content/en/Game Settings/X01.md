# Basic Game Rules


X01 is the most played darts game all over the world. The game starts with a score of X01. The objective is to get to exactly zero by throwing rounds of three darts and subtracting the sum of those darts from your current score. Once a playerâ€™s score reaches exactly zero, he wins the game. If nobody reaches zero after finishing all rounds, the player with the lowest score wins the game.


These are all the available settings at the moment. For a better explanation, please refer to the description below.
